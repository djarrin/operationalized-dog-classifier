# operationalized-dog-classifier
A dog classifier that will take advantage of multi-instance training and a scaled up inference endpoint.


## Notebook setup
I choose to us an ml.t3.medium notebook type because it will be generally lower cost than using a larger instance. For just code editing using a smaller instance will save money, If I need something more robust for training or inference I will deploy that sepratly.
